Key Features of the Nextflow Pipeline

Module Management:
Each process includes a module directive to load the required environment module (e.g., module fastqc/0.11.9).
Modules are unloaded automatically after the process completes.
Processes:
Each step of the pipeline is defined as a separate process, making the workflow modular and reusable.
Inputs and outputs are explicitly declared, ensuring data dependencies are clear.
Workflow:
The workflow block defines the order of execution for the processes.
Outputs from one process are passed as inputs to the next.
Parallelization:
Nextflow automatically parallelizes tasks where possible, improving efficiency.
Publishing Results:
The publishDir directive is used to copy final results to a specified output directory.
Parameterization:
Parameters like input_fastq, reference_genome, and output_dir are defined at the top of the script, making the pipeline flexible and easy to configure.
Running the Nextflow Pipeline

Save the script to a file (e.g., bioinformatics_pipeline.nf).
Ensure Nextflow is installed and environment modules are configured on your system.
Run the pipeline using the following command:
'''
nextflow run bioinformatics_pipeline.nf --input_fastq input.fastq.gz --reference_genome reference_genome.fa --output_dir results
''''
