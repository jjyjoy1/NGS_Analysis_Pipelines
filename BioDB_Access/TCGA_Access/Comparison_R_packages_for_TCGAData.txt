I compared the several of major R packages for accessing and analyzing TCGA data, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and use cases.

TCGAbiolinks
Strengths:
Comprehensive workflow from data download to analysis
Direct integration with GDC API
Handles multiple data types (RNA-seq, methylation, mutations, clinical)
Returns Bioconductor-compatible data structures (SummarizedExperiment)
Active development and maintenance
Extensive documentation and vignettes

Limitations:
Steeper learning curve for beginners
Can be memory-intensive for large datasets
Some functions have complex parameter requirements

Best for: Complete analysis workflows requiring multiple data types and integration with other Bioconductor tools.

GenomicDataCommons
Strengths:
Direct, lower-level access to GDC API
More flexible querying capabilities
Good for exploring metadata and available data types
Lightweight compared to TCGAbiolinks

Limitations:
Less pre-processing functionality
Requires more custom code for analysis
Fewer high-level analysis functions

Best for: Targeted data retrieval, exploring available data, and building custom analysis pipelines.


RTCGA
Strengths:
Provides pre-processed datasets
Simple and consistent API
Good for quick exploration of TCGA data
Integration with ggplot2 for visualizations

Limitations:
Uses older TCGA data (legacy database)
Not connected to current GDC API
Limited to pre-packaged datasets

Best for: Quick exploratory analysis and teaching purposes.

TCGAretriever
Strengths:
Simplified interface for downloading TCGA data
Easy filtering and subsetting of data
User-friendly for beginners
Good for retrieving specific datasets

Limitations:
Less comprehensive than TCGAbiolinks
Fewer analytical functions
Less active development

Best for: Beginners or those needing quick access to specific TCGA datasets.
