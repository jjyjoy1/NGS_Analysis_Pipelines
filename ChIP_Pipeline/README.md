I created ChIP NGS data analysis pipeline. 

The manifest file is crucial - it defines your samples and experimental design. Use the template I provided as a guide. The file should include:

sample_id: Unique identifier for each sample
condition: Experimental condition (e.g., treatment1, treatment2)
replicate: Replicate number
sample_type: Either "treatment" or "control"
 
Key Features of This Pipeline

Quality Control: FastQC analysis of raw reads
Read Processing: Adapter trimming with Trim Galore
Alignment: Bowtie2 alignment to reference genome
Post-processing: Filtering, deduplication, and indexing
Peak Calling: MACS2 peak calling for ChIP enrichment
Visualization: Generation of BigWig files for genome browsers
Differential Analysis: DiffBind-based differential binding analysis
Reporting: Comprehensive HTML report summarizing all results

And then I created an extended analysis which integrae with RNA sequence data. And this this is a common approach for understanding how transcription factor binding or histone modifications correlate with gene expression patterns.

Roadmap for Integrating ChIP-seq and Gene Expression Data
1. Data Preparation
ChIP-seq Data Processing

Peak Calling: Using your Snakemake pipeline, generate narrowPeak files
Peak Matrix Creation:

Associate peaks with genomic regions (especially promoters)
Create a matrix of peak scores per gene (presence/absence or signal strength)



Gene Expression Data

Ensure your gene expression matrix is normalized
Verify gene identifiers match those in your ChIP-seq data

2. Data Integration

Merge the ChIP-seq peak matrix with gene expression data
Resolve gene identifier mapping issues if necessary
Filter out genes with missing data or low expression

3. Correlation Analysis

Calculate Spearman correlations between ChIP-seq signals and gene expression
Identify significant correlations after multiple testing correction
Create correlation heatmaps between ChIP-seq features and gene expression

4. Predictive Modeling

Build regression models to predict gene expression from ChIP-seq data
Use elastic net regression to handle the high-dimensional ChIP-seq data
Evaluate models using cross-validation
Identify the most predictive ChIP-seq features

5. Feature Analysis

Identify genes with strong positive/negative correlations between ChIP-seq and expression
Analyze genomic regions (promoters, enhancers, etc.) where ChIP-seq signals best predict gene expression
Examine the relationship between peak distance from TSS and correlation with expression

6. Biological Interpretation

Perform pathway enrichment analysis on genes with strong ChIP-expression relationships
Compare binding patterns between different experimental conditions
Identify potential co-regulatory relationships

Key Considerations

Promoter vs. Enhancer Analysis: Consider analyzing promoter and enhancer regions separately
Distance Effects: The impact of ChIP-seq peaks on gene expression often depends on the distance from the gene
Multiple Peaks: A gene may be regulated by multiple binding sites
Condition-Specific Effects: The ChIP-gene expression relationship may vary across conditions

*****Note for R and Python implementations:

R Implementation: Uses packages like DiffBind, ChIPseeker, and glmnet for a comprehensive analysis
Python Implementation: Uses pybedtools, scikit-learn, and pandas for data integration and modeling

Both implementations follow the same conceptual workflow:

Load and process ChIP-seq peak data
Create a peak-to-gene mapping
Integrate with gene expression data
Perform correlation analysis
Build predictive models
Visualize key findings

#Version 2 added functional analysis:

Complete GO Analysis: Finished implementing the GO analysis for all three ontologies (BP, MF, CC) with proper visualization
KEGG Pathway Analysis: Added complete implementation of KEGG pathway enrichment with visualization of pathway diagrams using pathview
Reactome Pathway Analysis: Added Reactome pathway analysis for comprehensive pathway identification
Disease Ontology Analysis: Added Disease Ontology (DO) enrichment to identify disease associations
Transcription Factor Enrichment: Added MSigDB-based transcription factor enrichment analysis for human samples
Comprehensive Summary Report: Added a text-based summary report that provides a quick overview of all enrichment results
