I created a comprehensive Snakemake workflow for proteomics data analysis that covers all the key steps for proteomics data analysis.

Data Acquisition and Pre-processing

Converts vendor-specific formats (.raw) to open mzML format
Performs quality control checks on the MS data

Protein Identification

Performs database search against reference proteome
Controls false discovery rate at peptide and protein levels
Generates a list of identified proteins for each sample

Quantitative Proteomics

Extracts ion chromatograms for identified peptides
Maps features across samples for comparison
Calculates protein abundances

PTM Analysis

Identifies post-translational modifications
Localizes modifications to specific amino acid residues
Summarizes PTM sites

Differential Expression Analysis

Compares protein abundances between conditions
Calculates fold changes and statistical significance
Identifies up- and down-regulated proteins

Pathway Analysis

Performs enrichment analysis on differentially expressed proteins
Identifies biological pathways affected in your experiment
Provides functional context for your proteomics results

Final Report

Generates a comprehensive HTML report summarizing all analyses
