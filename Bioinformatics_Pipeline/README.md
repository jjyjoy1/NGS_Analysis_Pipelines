I created a generalized, matrix-based bioinformatics workflow that can indeed be summarized into a common ML/DL framework. Despite variations in specific datasets (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, metagenomics, WGAS, eQTL), the fundamental computational approach for ML-driven biomedical analyses can be structured into a generalizable pipeline.

The comprehensive workflow contains the following 8 steps.

Generalized Pipeline Summary: 
A universal ML/DL pipeline for various biomedical data (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, metagenomics, WGAS/eQTL)

Step 1: Preprocessing & Normalization (Input Matrix)

    Purpose:
    Convert raw values (counts, peak intensities, abundances, quantitative trait measurements) into normalized values to make data comparable and suitable for ML/DL models.

    Common Algorithms/Methods:
        RNA-seq: DESeq2 normalization, TMM (edgeR), TPM, variance-stabilizing transformations (VST), or log normalization.
        ChIP-seq: Reads-per-million (RPM), signal-to-noise normalization.
        Metagenomics: Relative abundance normalization, CLR (centered log-ratio) normalization.
        WGAS (eQTL): Standardization (z-scores).

Step 2: Feature Selection (Reducing Noise & Complexity)

    Purpose:
    Identify and retain only the most informative features (genes, peaks, taxa, QTL) to reduce noise and computational complexity.

    Common Algorithms/Methods (generalizable):
        Statistical tests:
            Univariate methods: ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
            Variance-based: Remove low-variance features.
        Regularization methods (embedded feature selection):
            LASSO (L1), ElasticNet.
        Tree-based methods:
            Random Forest importance, XGBoost/Shap values.
        Wrapper methods:
            Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
        DL-based:
            Autoencoders or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to identify latent representations.

Step 3: Dimensionality Reduction (Visualization & Interpretation)

    Purpose:
    Project high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions to visualize patterns and reduce complexity while maintaining key biological signals.

    Common Algorithms/Methods (generalizable):
        Linear methods:
            Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
            Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

            t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding)
            UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
            Autoencoders (deep learning)

Step 4: Clustering (Discovery of Biological Groups)

    Purpose:
    Group similar samples, conditions, or biological entities based on underlying data patterns.

    Common Algorithms/Methods (generalizable):
        Partition-based:
            K-means clustering
            K-medoids (PAM)

            Agglomerative clustering (Ward’s method, linkage methods)
        Density-based clustering:
            DBSCAN
        Model-based:
            Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
        Network-based:
            WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis, especially for RNAseq but applicable broadly)
        Spectral clustering (graph-based) methods (common in eQTL and genomic networks).

Step 5: Classification & Regression (Supervised Learning)

    Purpose:
    Predict labels, conditions, or outcomes based on input features (classification), or predict continuous biological variables (regression).

    Common Algorithms/Methods (generalizable):
        Classic ML methods:
            Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
        Deep Learning (DL):
            Fully Connected Networks (dense layers)
            Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) – especially if spatial features or patterns exist (e.g., ChIP-seq peak distribution)
            Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM/Bi-LSTM) – if sequential or temporal data involved.
            Transformer-based models if relationships/patterns in high-dimensional space are complex.

Step 6: Model Evaluation & Optimization

    Purpose:
    Evaluate performance of ML/DL models robustly, and optimize hyperparameters.

    Common Algorithms/Methods (generalizable):
        Cross-validation (CV), Bootstrapping
        Hyperparameter tuning: Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization (e.g., Optuna)

    Identify and interpret the features or mechanisms driving predictions.

Step 8: Biological Interpretation (Pathways & Functional Enrichment)

    Purpose:
    Biological interpretation of selected features to relate to pathways, functions, diseases.

    Common Algorithms/Methods:
        Functional Enrichment Analysis:
            Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG pathways, Reactome pathways, Disease Ontology (DO).
        Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Pathway enrichment with over-representation tests.
