BioinformaticsDimensionalityReducer provides comprehensive dimensionality reduction capabilities for bioinformatics data analysis.
Key Features:

Multiple Dimensionality Reduction Methods:

Linear methods: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
Nonlinear methods: t-SNE, UMAP, and Autoencoders
Each method maintains biological signal integrity in different ways


Visualization Tools:

Built-in plotting functions for reduced data visualization
Support for coloring by categorical or continuous variables
Explained variance plots for PCA
Feature loading plots to interpret components


Advanced Autoencoder Architecture:

Configurable network architecture with multiple hidden layers
Batch normalization and dropout for better regularization
Early stopping to prevent overfitting
Can learn complex nonlinear representations in the data


Interpretation Aids:

Methods to extract and visualize feature loadings/importance
For PCA, explained variance analysis to determine optimal dimensions
Feature contribution analysis for understanding biological meaning


Integration with Workflow:

Scikit-learn compatible API (fit, transform, fit_transform)
Works seamlessly with previous preprocessing and feature selection steps
Maintains DataFrame structure for better traceability


Model Persistence:

Methods to save and load trained models
Special handling for autoencoder models
