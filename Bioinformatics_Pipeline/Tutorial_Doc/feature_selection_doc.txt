FeatureSelector class that builds upon our preprocessing class. This feature selection class offers multiple approaches for identifying the most informative features in your bioinformatics data:
Key Features:

Statistical Methods:

Supports various statistical tests (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, t-tests) for both classification and regression tasks
Allows selection based on either top-k features or p-value thresholding


Variance-Based Filtering:

Implements removal of low-variance features with adjustable thresholds
Useful for eliminating near-constant features that provide little information


Regularization Methods:

LASSO (L1) and ElasticNet regularization for embedded feature selection
Selects features by identifying non-zero coefficients after training


Tree-Based Methods:

Random Forest and XGBoost importance metrics
Selects features based on their contribution to model performance


Wrapper Methods:

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for iteratively removing features
Can use any base estimator that provides feature importance scores


Deep Learning Approaches:

Standard Autoencoder architecture for unsupervised feature selection
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for learning latent representations



Integration Features:

Compatible with scikit-learn's API (fit, transform, fit_transform)
Can be easily chained with the BioinformaticsPreprocessor from Step 1
Returns both selected features and feature importance scores
Maintains DataFrame structure when possible for better interpretability
Built-in logging for tracking the feature selection process

This implementation provides a flexible foundation for feature selection across different types of bioinformatics data.
