I provided comprehensive methods for discovering biological groups in high-dimensional data.
Key Features:

Multiple Clustering Algorithms:

Partition-based: K-means and K-medoids (PAM)
Hierarchical: Agglomerative clustering with various linkage methods
Density-based: DBSCAN for detecting clusters of arbitrary shape
Model-based: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
Network-based: WGCNA for co-expression network analysis
Graph-based: Spectral clustering


Cluster Evaluation Metrics:

Internal validation: Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, Calinski-Harabasz index
External validation: Adjusted Rand Index, Adjusted Mutual Information (when true labels are available)
Network-specific metrics: Modularity score for WGCNA


Optimal Cluster Selection:

Methods to determine the optimal number of clusters
Elbow method, silhouette analysis, gap statistic, BIC
Consolidated recommendations across different metrics


Visualization Tools:

Cluster visualization in reduced dimensions
Dendrograms for hierarchical clustering
Silhouette plots for cluster quality assessment
Network visualizations for WGCNA
Heatmaps with cluster annotations
Validation metric plots for different cluster numbers


Integration Features:

Scikit-learn compatible API (fit, predict, fit_predict)
Works with the previous preprocessing, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction steps
Support for both DataFrame and NumPy array inputs
