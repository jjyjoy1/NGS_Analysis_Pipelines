I provided the BioinformaticsModelEvaluator class for Step 6 of your pipeline, providing comprehensive tools for model evaluation, optimization, and interpretation.
Key Features:
1. Robust Cross-Validation Strategies

Multiple CV approaches: k-fold, stratified, repeated, leave-one-out
Nested cross-validation for unbiased performance estimation
Bootstrap validation for confidence intervals

2. Advanced Hyperparameter Optimization

Grid Search: Exhaustive search over parameter combinations
Random Search: Efficient exploration of parameter space
Bayesian Optimization: Using Optuna for intelligent parameter tuning

3. Comprehensive Metrics

Classification: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrices
Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ², explained variance, correlation coefficients
Clustering: Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, Calinski-Harabasz index

4. Model Interpretation

Feature importance analysis using permutation methods
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for detailed feature impact
Learning curve analysis to diagnose underfitting/overfitting

5. Visualization Tools

Learning curves
ROC and Precision-Recall curves
Confusion matrices
Residual plots
Feature importance visualization

6. Deep Learning Support

Custom implementations for TensorFlow/Keras models
Handles both classification and regression deep learning models
Supports CNN, RNN, and Transformer architectures
