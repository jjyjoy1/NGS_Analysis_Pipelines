Preprocessor provides a flexible class for preprocessing and normalizing various types of bioinformatics data. Key features include:

Support for multiple data types (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, metagenomics, WGAS/eQTL)
Implementation of various normalization methods for each data type:

RNA-seq: log transformation, VST, TPM, DESeq2-like, TMM
ChIP-seq: RPM, signal-to-noise ratio
Metagenomics: relative abundance, CLR normalization
WGAS/eQTL: z-score standardization, rank-based normalization


Scikit-learn compatible API with fit_transform() and transform() methods
Built-in logging for tracking preprocessing steps
Flexible parameter passing through kwargs
