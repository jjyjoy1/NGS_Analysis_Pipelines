I created the BiologicalInterpreter class for Step 8 of your generalized, matrix-based bioinformatics workflow. Let me explain the key components and how they fit into your overall pipeline:
Core Functionality
The BiologicalInterpreter class provides:

Data Loading and Integration:

Methods to fetch and cache pathway data from KEGG, Gene Ontology, Reactome, and Disease Ontology
Organism-specific mapping for cross-species compatibility


Enrichment Analysis Methods:

Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) for gene lists
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for ranked gene lists
Statistical testing with hypergeometric test and permutation-based significance


Visualization Tools:

Bar plots showing enrichment scores or p-values
Bubble plots showing enrichment patterns
Heatmaps displaying gene-term associations
Network visualizations of pathway relationships


Reporting and Export:

HTML report generation with interactive elements
Export to various formats (CSV, TSV, Excel, JSON)
Network visualization for pathway interactions



Integration with Your ML/DL Framework
This module is designed to fit into your 12-step pipeline by:

Taking Input from Earlier Steps: The class accepts gene lists or scores from feature selection steps
Maintaining the Matrix-Based Approach: All enrichment results are returned as structured pandas DataFrames
Supporting Diverse Data Types: Works with different types of omics data (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, etc.)
Enabling Reusability: Implemented as a class that can be easily imported and reused

Usage in Pipeline
In a typical workflow:

After feature selection or differential analysis (previous steps in your pipeline)
Pass significant features to BiologicalInterpreter
Run appropriate enrichment analysis (ORA or GSEA)
Visualize and interpret the results
Generate reports for biological insights
