 I created a comprehensive XAI class that helps interpret and explain predictions from bioinformatics machine learning models. This implementation provides multiple complementary approaches to model explanation, catering to both global model understanding and detailed instance-level explanations.
Key Features:

Multiple Explanation Methods:

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): For rigorous attribution of feature contributions to model outputs
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): For locally faithful instance-level explanations
Feature Importance: Extraction from native model attributes and permutation-based approaches
Attention Visualization: For transformer/LSTM models to understand which input elements the model focuses on


Broad Model Support:

Tree-based models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting
Linear models: Logistic Regression, SVMs
Deep Learning: CNN, LSTM, Transformer architectures from TensorFlow/Keras


Visualization Tools:

SHAP summary plots (bar, dot, and violin plots)
SHAP dependence plots to analyze feature interactions
SHAP waterfall plots for individual prediction explanations
LIME visualization for local explanations
Attention heatmaps for sequence models


Comprehensive Reporting:

Generate consolidated HTML reports with visualizations
Export explanations in JSON format for further analysis
