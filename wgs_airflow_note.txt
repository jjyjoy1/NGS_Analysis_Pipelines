Explanation of Changes

Module Management:
Each task now includes module load and module unload commands to manage the computing environment.
For example, module load fastqc/0.11.9 loads the FastQC module before running the fastqc command, and module unload fastqc/0.11.9 unloads it afterward.

Environment Variables:
Some bioinformatics tools (e.g., Picard, Trimmomatic) use environment variables like $TRIMMOMATIC_HOME or $PICARD_HOME to locate their JAR files. Ensure these variables are set correctly in your environment.

Tool Versions:
The versions of the tools (e.g., fastqc/0.11.9, gatk/4.2.0.0) are specified in the module load commands. Update these versions to match the ones available in your environment.

Task Dependencies:
The task dependencies remain the same, ensuring the pipeline runs in the correct order.
