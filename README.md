# NGS data analysis pipelines project will be a growing up snake, longer and longer

Overview
This repository contains a suite of bioinformatics pipelines optimized for processing and analyzing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. These pipelines are designed with a focus on:

Reproducibility: Containerized environments and version-controlled dependencies
Scalability: Efficient resource utilization for datasets of any size
Flexibility: Modular components that can be combined for custom workflows
Usability: Comprehensive documentation and intuitive interfaces
