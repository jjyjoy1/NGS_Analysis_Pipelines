# snakemake_pipelines project will be a growing up snake, longer and longer

I used Easybuild to manage HPC/AWS/locak server working environment, and then used snakemake/Nextflow/bash to manage the individual NGS pipeline on HPC/AWS/local server. As the pipeline working environment can be build based on the pipeline required, the pipelines can be translpanted on anywhere. In the meantime, if the custom pipeline also  need to be created, the working environment can be modified following the new requirements.
